# MYSQL Project

This repository contains SQL scripts focused on **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using MySQL.  
It is designed to demonstrate how SQL can be applied for preparing raw datasets and uncovering insights through queries.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`DATA CLEANING IN MYSQL.sql`**  
  Contains SQL queries for cleaning datasets, handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data formats, and preparing the data for analysis.

- **`EDA IN MYSQL.sql`**  
  Includes SQL queries for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), such as descriptive statistics, aggregations, and identifying patterns/trends in the dataset.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Data Cleaning operations:
  - Removing duplicates
  - Handling NULL/missing values
  - Standardizing and formatting data
  - Filtering irrelevant records

- EDA operations:
  - Summary statistics
  - Grouping and aggregations
  - Distribution analysis
  - Key insights extraction

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MySQL** – SQL database used for querying, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srishtisinha630/MYSQL.git
Open the .sql files in your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or CLI).

Import your dataset into MySQL.

Run the scripts in order:

Start with DATA CLEANING IN MYSQL.sql to prepare the dataset.

Then run EDA IN MYSQL.sql for analysis and insights.

📈 Example Use Cases
Cleaning raw sales, customer, or product datasets before analysis.

Performing SQL-based EDA without external tools.

Learning how to structure SQL scripts for real-world data workflows.

📌 Future Enhancements
Add sample datasets for testing.

Include advanced SQL operations (window functions, CTEs, subqueries).

Visualization support using BI tools (Power BI, Tableau) after MySQL queries.
